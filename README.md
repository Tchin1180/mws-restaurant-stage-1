# Restaurant Review App
---
## Project Overview:

This is an app for finding restaurants close by (using a map), also allowing the ability to filter restaurants by cuisine type, being able to read customer reviews and looking up a restaurant hours of operation.

### How to install:

1. Clone or download the [Repository](https://github.com/Tchin1180/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git) to your local machine.
2. Once the files are on your local machine, run any server locally.
3. Visit the site using http://localhost:8000 on your local browser.

### What you can do?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
