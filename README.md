# Restaurant Review App
---
## Project Overview:

This is an app for finding restaurants close by (using a map), also allowing the ability to filter restaurants by cuisine type, being able to read customer reviews and looking up a restaurant hours of operation.

### How to install:

1. Clone or download the [Repository](https://github.com/Tchin1180/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git) to your local machine.
2. Once the files are on your local machine, run any server locally.
3. Visit the site using http://localhost:8000 on your local browser.

### How does the app work:

1. When arriving on the homepage, you can look at restaurants on the map and click on the map marker to direct to a restaurant page.
2. You can also filter the map markers by selecting a certain neighborhood or certain cuisine.
3. You can click on "View Details" on any of the restaurants you want to view more details on.
4. Each restaurant page has the restaurant Name, a restaurant image, restaurant location, and hours of operation.
5. Each restaurant page also has a list of reviews with user feedback.
