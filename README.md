# Restaurant Review App
---
## Project Overview:

This is an app for finding restaurants nearby, filtering restaurants by cuisine type or neighborhoods, being able to read customer reviews and looking up a restaurant information and hours of operation.

### How to install:

1. Clone or download the [Repository](https://github.com/Tchin1180/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git) to your local machine.
2. Once the files are on your local machine, run any server locally.
3. Visit the site using http://localhost:8000 on your local browser.

### How does the app work:

1. On the homepage, you can look at restaurants on the map and or the restaurant list. If you click on any of the map marker, it will direct you to an individual restaurant page.
2. Back on the homepage, you can also filter the map markers by selecting a certain neighborhood or a certain cuisine.
3. In the restaurant list, Yyu can click on "View Details" on any of the restaurant you want to view more details on.
4. Each restaurant page has the restaurant name, a restaurant image, restaurant location, and hours of operation.
5. Each restaurant page also has a list of reviews with user feedback.
